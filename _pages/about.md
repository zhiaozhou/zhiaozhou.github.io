Background
======
My past education at Shanghai University of Finance & Economics and graduate study at New York University provided me with access to professional statistical and data science studies including but not limited to Calculus, Real Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, Stochastic Process, Applied Data Science, Data Structure and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Besides, I’m now also starting my second master’s degree in computer science in Georgia Institute of Technology as well, to get a deeper dive of the Computer Science concepts. The learning process itself laid me a solid ground in mathematical, statistical and computational studies and practice. 

Research Experiences
======
I've completed quite a few projects during my previous study with concentrations on Machine Learning. First, I led a team to train a classification and object detection model to measure the traffic density using traffic cameras in New York City using open source training data and TensorFlow. We first trained an Inception Resnet V2 classifier, regarding every number of cars in an image as a class and obtained a F1-score of 99.03% on test set. However, it turned out that the classifier runs too slowly on a traffic cam as it took more than 10 seconds to deal with one single frame and it cannot predict the class that is not inside our training set. Consequently, we decided to further train an object detector using Faster RCNN with Inception Resnet V2, resulting in a mean average precision of 80%. At last, we developed a demo that works on several traffic cams in Manhattan, New York City. Second, I have done another project aimed to segment overlapping digits using Capsule Network that was just published by Geoffrey Hinton who is the father of Neural Networks in 2017. A CapsNet is said to outperform a Convolutional Neural Network in plenty of aspects. We started from scratch and trained a CapsNet using Multi-MNIST dataset. Finally, we obtained an accuracy of 84% and an F1-score of 98%. Finally, I’ve been doing several side projects in my leisure time, such as a Python package that can download attachments from NYU Classes automatically, a Python package that can download as many images as you want on certain keywords from Google Image, and so on. They can all be found on my GitHub page or on the portfolio page.

Career Goal
======
During my undergraduate study in Actuarial Science, I was obsessed with equity analysis, using the fundamentals of a stock for evaluation and prediction of the stock outlook. The concept of quantitative finance had been around for many years in the U.S. and has certainly become a buzzword in the Chinese market as well. I was fascinated by the effective usage of quantitative finance and thus wrote my graduation dissertation on finding the effective fundamental factors affecting different sectors of stocks in China using quantitative finance. To support the content of my paper, I had to self-learn Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Through this learning experience, I became interested in computational data analysis, using sophisticated data models and efficient programming to solve problems. It was not until my internship as a quantitative analyst in a top tier investment bank in China that I fell in love with Computer Science. The goal of the team project was to build a robotic advisor in the future that could automatically work out a broad asset allocation plan for those "low net-worth" customers. I was obsessed with building a robotic financial advisor system that helps investors allocate their assets. Consequently, I set my career goal to be a advanced Artificial Intelligence engineer in the FinTech field.
