What's up! I am Zhiao Zhou who is now working on building a robotic financial advisor in an investment bank in Shanghai, China. I studied Actuarial Science and Finance during my undergraduate study. Then I graduated from [NYU CUSP](http://cusp.nyu.edu/) in 2018 which is a school founded in 2012 to respond to the request by NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg to build an engineering and applied sciences campus in New York City. During my study at CUSP, I did several urban-related research and projects using machine learning and computer vision. And I'm also starting my second Master's degree at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2018, majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) with a concentration on Machine Learning, in order to get a deeper view of Artificial Intelligence(AI). I'm interested in AI's application in financial areas especially in the capital market. During my spared time, I'm also working on several side projects which you can find in the "Projects" page.
If you are interested to have a talk with me, feel free to drop a message below or contact.
